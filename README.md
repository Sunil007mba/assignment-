1. A developer is assigned a task to scrape 1 lakh website pages from a directory site, while scrapping he is facing such hcaptcha, which are placed to stop people from scrapping As a project Coordinator suggest ways to solve this problem

 2. Our client has around 10k LinkedIn people profiles, he wants to know the estimated income range of these profiles. Suggest ways on how to do this?

 3. We have a list of 1L company names, need to find LinkedIn company links of these profiles, how to go about this?

 4. How to identify list of companies whose tech stack is built on Python. Give names of 5 companies, if possible, by your suggested approach

5. Need to find an API, through which we can send LinkedIn messages to other LinkedIn users.


Solution 1:
The best method to use will depend on a number of factors, including the specific website that we are scraping and your budget. We are scraping a large number of pages, we will need to use an automated solution.
One Solution is using a CAPTCHA resolver, make sure to choose one that is reputable and has a good track record of solving hCAPTCHAs. But CAPTCHA resolvers can be expensive, especially if we are scraping a large number of pages.
If we are on a tight budget, we may want to consider rotating your IP addresses and User-Agent strings. This is a free solution, but it may not be as effective as using a CAPTCHA resolver.
Additionally for scraping directory sites without triggering hCAPTCHAs:
Be respectful of the website's bandwidth and rate limits. Don't send too many requests too quickly.
Avoid scraping the same pages too often.
Use a human-like browser to scrape the pages.
If we are using a headless browser, such as Phantom JS or Puppeteer, try to make it look more like a real browser.
If we are using a proxy service, make sure that the proxies are high quality and that they don't have a history of being used for scraping.

Solution 2:
If Our client only has around 10,000 LinkedIn profiles, I would recommend using LinkedIn Salary or a third-party salary calculator to estimate the income range for each profile. This will be the quickest and easiest approach.
Also We can use LinkedIn Salary Insights. LinkedIn Salary Insights is a feature that provides salary estimates for different job titles, locations, and industries. To use this feature, you need to have a LinkedIn Premium subscription.
If Our client needs more accurate income estimates, you could consider training a machine learning model. However, this would require a larger dataset of LinkedIn profiles with known income data.


Solution 3:
There are two main ways to find LinkedIn company links for a list of 1L company names:
1. Manually
This is the most time-consuming method, but it is also the most accurate. To do this, we would need to go to LinkedIn and search for each company name individually. Once we have found the company's profile, we can copy the URL from our browser's address bar.
2. Using a tool
There are a number of tools available that can help us to find LinkedIn company links in bulk. These tools typically work by scraping LinkedIn for the company profiles that match our list of company names.
One popular tool for this is called Botster. To use Botster, we would simply need to create an account and enter your list of company names. Botster will then scrape LinkedIn and generate a list of LinkedIn company URLs for us.
Another popular tool is called Derrick. Derrick works in a similar way to Botster, but it also offers a number of other features, such as the ability to find email addresses and social media profiles for company employees.
Additionally,When using a tool to find LinkedIn company links, make sure that the tool is reputable and that it uses safe and ethical methods. 
Once we have a list of LinkedIn company links, we can verify their accuracy by visiting each link manually.
we can also use a tool like LinkedIn Sales Navigator to enrich our list of LinkedIn company links with additional information, such as the number of employees, the company's industry, and the company's location.


Solution 4:
There are a few ways to identify a list of companies whose tech stack is built on Python. 
One way is to look at job postings. Many companies will list the programming languages that they use in their job postings. We can also look at company websites and blog posts. Many companies will discuss their tech stack on their websites and blog posts.
Another way to identify companies that use Python is to use a tool like BuiltWith. BuiltWith is a website that allows you to see the technologies that are used on a particular website. To use BuiltWith, simply enter the URL of a website and BuiltWith will tell you what technologies are used on that website.
Here are 5 companies whose tech stack is built on Python, based on my suggestion:
Google
Netflix
Spotify
Dropbox
Reddit
Additionally to identifying companies that use Python:
Look for companies that are involved in web development, data science, or machine learning. These are all areas where Python is widely used.
Look for companies that are innovative and cutting-edge. Python is a popular language for startups and other companies that are constantly developing new products and services.
Attend industry events and meetups. This is a great way to network with people who work at companies that use Python.
Once you have identified a list of companies that use Python, you can verify their tech stack by visiting their websites and blog posts. You can also look for job postings from these companies.

Solution 5:
There is no official LinkedIn API for sending messages to other LinkedIn users. However, there are a number of unofficial APIs available, such as:
Beeper
Linked Helper
Phantombuster
Zapier
These APIs work by scraping LinkedIn for the messages that us want to send. However, it is important to note that using these APIs is against LinkedIn's terms of service. If LinkedIn catches us using one of these APIs, they may suspend or ban our account.

If we need to send LinkedIn messages in bulk, I recommend using a service like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. LinkedIn Sales Navigator allows us to send InMail messages to other LinkedIn users, even if we are not connected to them.
